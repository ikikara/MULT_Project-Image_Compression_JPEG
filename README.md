## Description:
This was the 1st project developed for Multimedia subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering <br>
Consists in develop a program that makes a study about JPEG algorithm and his steps of compression like conversion to YCbCr, DownSampling, DCT, Quantization and DPCM.

#### Main Languages:

## Technologies used:
1. Python
    - [Version 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
2. Libraries
    - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
    - [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## To run this project:
[WARNING] Python 3.9 and the libraries refered must be installed <br>
You have one way to run this project:
1. Using Terminal
    - Download the folders "src" and "resources"
    - Put in a folder these 2 folders
    - Navigate to the folder created
    - And then execute the following command on terminal: 
        ```shellscript
        [your-disk]:[name-path]> python main.py
        ```

## Notes important to read:
   - If you want to change the image to do compression or type of downsampling change the variable *file* and *sampling* respectively in main.
   - If you want to change the directory of the images change the variable *IMAGES_PATH* on top of the code.
   - If you want to see the plots and prints of each step change the respectively variables to true on main.
